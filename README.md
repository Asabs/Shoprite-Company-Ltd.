The system also shows all paid and unpaid transactions related to the items. The system also enables managing system users, among other things. This project, it appears, includes an admin panel, a management panel, and a client panel. A system administrator has complete control over this web application, according to an overview. He or she is capable of overseeing sales, inventories, and staff. An administrator can do nearly anything here, but their primary responsibility is still managing the system's flow.
A manager's account also has access to handle all inventory-related actions. A management can list out, add to, remove from, and update the inventories of a corporation here. The technology actually enables management of sales records. The system needs information about inventories, such as the name of the model, parts, kind, and price, in order to manage inventory. Every item also has a stock quantity, which the manager or administrator also controls. Additionally, as soon as a product completes the transaction process, the system instantly subtracts the quantity of that product. Additionally, the manager can produce a variety of reports in PDF format. It contains information about item lists, orders, and other things.
